 This is a two player game made using Pygame module.
 
 In this game, two player can play against each other as two spaceships. The player who gets 10 points first wins the game by shooting laser to each other.

 Despite being so simple, this game has some features like:
 </br>
 -Movement to both ships
 </br>
 -Shooting laser
 </br>
 -Collision detection
 </br>
 -Score keeping
 </br>
 -Game over screen
 </br>
 -Restart game feature
 </br>
 -Game sounds

 In this game I learned to use Pygame module, handle events, create game loop, use classes for game objects, handle collisions, play sounds using "Pygame.mixer" module, and create game over screen.

 Of course I didn't learned all this all by myself, I used many online resources and tutorials to learn Pygame and implement this game.
 I hope you'll enjoy playing this game and I'm happy to hear any feedback or suggestions you may have.

 Thank You!
 Enjoy!!
